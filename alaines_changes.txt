4/13/22:

Removed some of the dynamic memory from Movie.h (left in some of the big three, remove later?)
Changed directors in Movie.h to be a vector (it won't be very long, a dynamic string array is more difficult)
Created Heap.h and Heap.cpp
Did some light testing on inserting into a Heap
Did some light testing on extracting from a Heap
Needs more tests!

4/16/22:
Changed up Movie.h somewhat (genres array is now a vector)
    Added functions to read in info
    yeah
Datasets folder contains the adjusted Datasets
Created Director.h (it was necessary to read in the director)
Function for reading stuff is in main()
**NOTE: REGEX FOR GENRES IS BROKEN! NEEDS FIXING**
No work on the heap today
